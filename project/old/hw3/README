hw3: lighting and 3d objects

***** I used the normals of .6 and .4 on the slants in the star seeing as none of them go in the z direction. This seems to be the best lighting I could get out of the scence. I also tried .7 and .3, and .8 and .2 but these did not work as well. Hopefully it looks correct to the user ******

Hours to complete: 15 hours
