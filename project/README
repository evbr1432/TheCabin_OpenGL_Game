Final Projects: The Cabin

Should run with make as long as you have SDL installed as in the example sdl21.


I think the collision detection has a lot of potential, but I did not have enough time to fully implement it. It creates a sphere around all objects and the player then uses triginometry to detemain if they are collided.

I took a lot of time picking the correct textures for each object.

The music really ties everything together.
